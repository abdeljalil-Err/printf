# Project's Title:
_printf() project.

# Project Description:
Welcome to our first group project in ALX program! We aim to create a custom _printf() function that replicates the functionality of the printf() function from the C Standard Library.

 ## What \ _printf()\ does :
 Send output to stdout according to a format argument, similar to the printf() function.

# Project Requirements:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project

# Repository files :
README.md : Readme file;
main.h : The header files;
_printf() : The mean function file;
_printchar(): print character file;
_printstring(): print string file;
_printmodulo(): print modulo file.

#Exemples :
1. Printing a string of character "Hello, world":

	•Use : _printf("Hello, w%s");
	•Output : Hello, world.
2. Print a character 'c';

	•Use : _putchar("I like to programming withe %c langage", c );
	•Output : I like to programming withe c langage.

3. Printing the integer number:

	•Use : _printf("20 + 10 = %d", 30);
	•Output : 20 + 10 = 30.
